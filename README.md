# EXP-4 -> EVEN NUMBERS

## AIM :
TO Write a Java program to print the even numbers between 1-20

## SOFTWARE REQUIRED :
IntelliJ IDEA COMMUNITY EDITION

## ALGORITHM :

To print the even numbers between 1 and 20 in Java, you can use the following algorithm:

1) Start a loop that iterates from 1 to 20.
2) Check if the current number is even or not.
3) If the number is even, print it.
4) Repeat steps 2-3 for each number in the loop.
5) End the loop.

## PROGRAM :

```java


public class Main
{
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       for(int i=1;i<=20;i++)
       {
           if(i%2==0)
           {
               System.out.print(" " + i );
           }
       }
   }
}

```
